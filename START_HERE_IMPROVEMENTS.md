# 🚀 CRM Improvements - Ready to Implement

I've prepared everything you need! Since your files are on the hosted version, here are your options:

## ✅ What I've Prepared:

1. **CRM_IMPROVEMENTS_GUIDE.md** - Complete code changes for all 4 improvements
2. All improvement details documented

## 🎯 The 4 Improvements:

1. ✅ Client creation - contact info autopopulates in next screen
2. ✅ Services - "Special Projects" field added
3. ✅ Service Banner - hourly rate selection and input
4. ✅ Prospects - removed $75k auto-populate

## 📋 Next Steps - Choose One:

### Option 1: I Create Complete Files (Fastest)
Tell me: **"Create the files with improvements"** and I'll create:
- Complete `main.py` with all routes and improvements
- Complete `models.py` with new fields
- Updated templates with improvements
- Ready to deploy!

### Option 2: Manual Application
Use `CRM_IMPROVEMENTS_GUIDE.md` - it has exact code to change

### Option 3: Provide Your Files
If you can share your current files (main.py, models.py, templates), I'll:
- Implement all improvements directly
- Test them
- Give you updated files
