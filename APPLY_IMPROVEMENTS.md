# Quick Instructions to Apply Improvements

Since your files are on the hosted version, here's the fastest way to apply the improvements:

## Method 1: I'll Create Updated Files (Recommended)

I can create complete updated files with all improvements. You can then:
1. Download your current files from Render/GitHub
2. Replace them with my improved versions
3. Test and deploy

## Method 2: Manual Application

Use the `CRM_IMPROVEMENTS_GUIDE.md` I created - it has step-by-step code changes.

## Method 3: Direct Edit on Hosted Version

If you have access to edit files on Render, I can provide the exact code snippets to change.
