# How to Get Files from Hosted Version

Since your files are on the hosted version (Render), here are options:

## Option 1: Pull from GitHub (Recommended)

If your code is on GitHub:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\PaulOhlms\Desktop\CRM Tool"
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/paulohlms/tierney-ohlms-crm.git
git pull origin main
```

## Option 2: Download from Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your web service
3. Go to "Settings" → "Source"
4. You can see the GitHub repository link
5. Clone or download from there

## Option 3: I'll Create the Files

I can recreate the essential files with all improvements implemented. Just let me know!

**Which option would you prefer?** Or if you can provide access to the files, I can implement the improvements directly.
