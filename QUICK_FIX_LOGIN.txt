QUICK FIX FOR LOGIN ISSUE
=========================

The test showed 0 users in the database. Here's how to fix it:

STEP 1: Create Admin Users
--------------------------
Run this command:

    python create_admin_users.py

This will create:
  - Paul@tierneyohlms.com / ChangeMe123!
  - Dan@tierneyohlms.com / ChangeMe123!


STEP 2: Verify It Worked
------------------------
Run the test again:

    python test_login.py

You should now see:
  - Total users: 2
  - Login test PASSED


STEP 3: Try Logging In
----------------------
Go to: http://localhost:8000/login

Use:
  Email: Paul@tierneyohlms.com
  Password: ChangeMe123!


STEP 4: Change Your Password!
------------------------------
After logging in, IMMEDIATELY go to Settings and change your password.


WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?
--------------------
The bootstrap function should create users automatically when the server starts,
but it may have failed silently or the server wasn't restarted after we added it.

The create_admin_users.py script manually creates the users, which is more reliable.


FUTURE PREVENTION
-----------------
The bootstrap function will run every time you start the server. If you see:
  "✅ Found X existing user(s). Skipping bootstrap."
Then everything is working correctly.
