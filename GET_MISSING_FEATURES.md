# Missing Features - Timesheets & User Management

## The Problem
Your website is missing:
- ❌ Timesheet functionality
- ❌ User management (Settings)
- ❌ Navigation links for these features

## The Solution
These features exist in an earlier commit. We need to restore them.

## What I Need From You

**Option 1: Get Files from Hosted Version (Easiest)**
If your hosted website has these features working, we can download the files from there.

**Option 2: Restore from Git History**
I can restore the files from an earlier commit that had these features.
