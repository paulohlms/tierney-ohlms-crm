# CRM Improvements Plan

## Improvements to Implement:

1. **Client Creation Flow - Autopopulate Contact Info**
   - When creating a client, contact info should flow into the next screen
   - No need to re-enter contact information

2. **Services - Add "Special Projects" Field**
   - Add a new field to services for "Special Projects"

3. **Service Banner - Hourly Rate Selection**
   - Allow selecting "hourly" billing type
   - Add input field for hourly rate

4. **Prospects - Remove $75k Auto-populate**
   - Don't auto-populate $75k for prospects if revenue is not entered
   - Only show revenue if explicitly entered

## Implementation Approach:

Since files are missing locally but the app works on hosted version, I'll:
1. Recreate essential files based on structure
2. Implement all 4 improvements
3. Test each improvement
4. Provide instructions for deployment
